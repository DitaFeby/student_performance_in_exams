# student_performance_in_exams
In this project, I do analyze for student performance in exams with kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exam
This dataset has 1000 rows and 8 coloumns. Here is the detail.
- gender: divided by female and male
- race/ethnicity: divided into 5 groups, A to E
- parental level of educational: there are 6 levels
- lunch: there are 2 types of student's lunch; standard and free/reduced
- test preparation course: it divided students by completed the course or not

The objectives of my analyze are:
How the student gender is distributed?
How each subjects are distributed?
Which race/ethnicity does have high score?
Does the parental level of education give impact to the student score?
Which type of lunch tend to give impact to the student score?
Does test preparation course help the student to get high score?

All the answers can be find out in my notebook. But, I'll share you my some insight below.
